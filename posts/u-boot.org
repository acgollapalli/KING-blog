* Progress report
Well I got u-boot, a bootloader for ARM systems (and others) to run in QEMU
After installing the requisite dependencies and cross-compiling u-boot for arm, I ran it, and it ran.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
qemu-system-aarch64 -curses -machine virt -cpu cortex-a57 -bios u-boot.bin
#+END_SRC
You can hit Esc+1 to get into QEMU's monitoring interface, and Esc+2 to get into a u-boot command line. Note that you have to hold it for a couple seconds, and it may take a couple tries for QEMU to respond. I don't know why this is. But the point is I can emulate an ARM processor and bootloader!

Now I just have to write something for it to boot.
